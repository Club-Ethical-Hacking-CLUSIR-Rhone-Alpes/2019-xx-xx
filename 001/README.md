### Scenario

**!! WARNING !!!**
This challenge contains operational viruses, you must not run them on your computer at any time! We strongly advise you to use a virtual machine to avoid any compromise. CLUSIR and Cyberprotect decline any responsibility in the event of infection.

Congratulations, you have just been hired in a large multi-national SOC as an analyst. It's your first day, after having a coffee and taking possession of your computer, you receive your first alert (`alerts.txt`) and a network capture (`ok10.22.15.0.pcap`). 

Your task is to investigate this alert and propose an effective solution to rectify the incident. To be able to return home, you must therefore find: 

    1. The host name of the infected computer. 
    2. The MAC address of the infected computer. 
    3. The account used on the infected machine. 
    4. Domains and IP addresses of any traffic associated with the infection. 
    5. A chronology of events that led to the infection. 
    6. Relevant information about malware 
    7. A remediation solution and a list of IoC (compromise indicator) 

To help you in your work, we strongly advise you to use services such as:

    - https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com (requires an account)
    - https://www.virustotal.com
    - https://otx.alienvault.com
    - https://threatscore.cyberprotect.fr

For step #6, you can use the files contained in the `sandboxing` folder. These are documents generated by our FortiSandbox after malware analysis.
